# Python-DotsAndBoxes 
######(Käsekästchen in german)
This game is about closing boxes.

It is played with two players. To draw a wall click on it. The player who draws the last wall around a box will "own" it. If you closed a box you can draw another wall directly, otherwise it is the other players turn.

At the end the player with the most closed boxes wins the game.

To start a game do:
```
python dotsAndBoxes.py
```
You can add a number as an argument to change the size of the game.
```
python dotsAndBoxes.py 20
```
The command above would start a 20x20 game. The default size is 10x10.
